1) Go on the feedback page.
2) Inspect the form element.
3) Notice a plain javascript function called when submitting the form.
4) enter script in either of the fields.

-------

1) enter <script>alert(1)</script> multiple times with other <script> tags
2) enter <script>'a'</script>

The function to check Form doesn't exist.

How to avoid ?

- Escape characters in HTML or XML, especially < and > so that the browser
interprets it only as data, not as code.
- Validation, filtering the user input so that the browser interprets it 
as code without malicious commands.
