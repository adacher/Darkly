We check if the site as the robot.txt file. This file is used to tell the search engine wich pages or files it can ask to the site,
to prevent to many request.

It is there and we see that we have 2 folders, and one of them is /whatever and contains htpassw file with a combination login:pasword :
root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3

md5 ( 8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3 ) = dragon

We try to go to http://local_IP/admin/ and use root as login and dragon as password. 


Don't trust the robots.txt convention !
Protect access to sensitives folders with .htaccess for example.
