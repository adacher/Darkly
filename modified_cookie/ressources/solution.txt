How to avoid ?
If you want cookies to be protected from sniffing and encrypted:
- Enforce SSL (HTTPS) and disable HTTP.
- Set Secure flag on all cookies (tells the user's browser to only send back this cookie over HTTPS connections).
- Check third party contents are using HTTPS as well.

- Don't store the admin session in a cookie ...
