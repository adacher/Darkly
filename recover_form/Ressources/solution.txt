On recover password page, we see a strange submit button alone. 
If we press it we get "sorry wrong answer" so we try to submit something else. 
If we inspect, we can see that we can change the mail on "value" attribut of input named "mail".

Flag appears.

This form can be used to send mails with a looping script for example.

You can avoid this, just don't use sensitive data in form attributes and do it in back.
